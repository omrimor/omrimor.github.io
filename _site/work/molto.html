<p>Molto began as an iPad email app called Incredimail focused on a primary target audience of second wave adopters.
It was well-received, got good feedback from users and one of the main things we learned was the fact that the app
was very popular among a much younger audience. It was rebranded as "Molto", and with with the collected findings, reviews
and costumer requests, we began developing the concept for our iPhone app.</p>

<p>It was clear right from the start we'll need an app that will stand out in the competitive iPhone market.
Email is still one of the most used activities on the iPhone, and a closer look at our competition, reveled how counter productive &amp;unaesthetically pleasing this activity is.</p>

<p>Clutter and countless number of text rows produces readability issues, that requires an extra effort from the end user to get the right info he needs, in addition to a far less delightful overall experience.<br> Email can be much better than this.</p>

<p>The clear and functional approach on the iPad worked great, and even though other layouts were tested, we always came back to the card layout.</p>

<p>It provides great readability, light on the eye (with the right visual space), easy to undesrstand &amp; manipulate on touch surfaces, and can be dynamically adjusted to fit content and handle better context functionality.</p>

<p>We optimized the app for a single hand usage (It's also great for two handed operation). The app's most used actions were centered in the middle canvas: Browsing, deleting, editing and mail quick actions were all within a thumb reach.</p>

<p>Every feature that was inserted in the app, was broken down to the tiniest details in order to provide maximum usability. Detailed UI documents show designers, developers and QA engineers the clearest goal we are aiming for.<br>
Lean prototyping with Axure enabled us to test a lot of things before they were developed, tweaking the necessary and optimizing usability.</p>

<p>Transitions and amination was a big part of the work. We used sublte yet delightful animations not only to engage users
but also to serve as functional cues to their actions.</p>

<p>We are used to zoom in and out with a pinch, so why not using the gesture to get a condence view of messages for quick scanning trough your inbox.<br>
Scrolling between messages emphasizes the message layers &amp; depth. (sweet easter egg if you reach the last message).<br>
A quick swipe to the left reveals the edit mode beneath them, ready for multiple selection.</p>

<p>QuickActions were designed under the assumption that a user will want a quick access to common actions right from the main mailbox feed - respond, star or forward the sender's message.<br>
The most frequent contacts, just a swipe a way. Backgrounds on the side menu change according to time and location.<br>
Pull to refresh gave us an opportunity to do some magic with the brand.</p>

<p>Molto was warmly welcomed and has earned excellent critical and technical reviews, and was hugely popular.<br>
Sadly, Perion decided to put Molto into maintenance mode and stop supporting the app or working on new features due to bigger stratigic shift the company had been going through. This kind of thing happens in big companies all time but I enjoyed every minute of the work and product, a lot because of a great design team
